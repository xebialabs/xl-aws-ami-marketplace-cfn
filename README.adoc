= XL Platform Installation on AWS Marketplace

== Description

<marketing stuff here I guess?>

== Contents

This repository contains a set of AWS CloudFormation YAML templates that allows you to set up the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform on AWS. 

== Step by step guide

This setup supports two use cases, described below. 

=== 1. New VPC Setup

In this use case, the administrator should already have the following AWS resources configured in order to deploy the XL Platform:

- A valid SSL certificate in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) in order to expose the ALB endpoints over HTTPS
- A key pair to SSH into the instances

==== All resources from the Existing VPC use-case, as well as the following additional resources, will be provisioned:

- A new VPC, containing
  * Private subnets
  * Public subnets
  * Data subnets
  * Internet gateway
  * Elastic IP addresses
- A new Aurora PostgreSQL RDS setup, consisting of
  * Security group allowing internal access
  * Primary Aurora instance
  * Optional secondary Aurora instance if Multi-AZ deployment is enabled
- Bastion auto-scaling group, with an Elastic IP attached for HA capability

The following is an example of the CloudFormation parameters -

=== 2. Existing VPC Setup

In this use case, the administrator should already have the following AWS resources configured in order to deploy the XL Platform:

- A VPC
- At least two public subnets
- At least two private subnets
- An RDS Instance (we recommend using the PostgreSQL flavour)
- A Bastion host(s) and associated security group
- A valid SSL certificate in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) in order to expose the ALB endpoints over HTTPS
- A key pair to SSH into the instances

NOTE: The public and private subnets are responsible for traffic segregation. Never expose your databases and other non-public services on public subnets. The only resource that should be directly attached to the public subnet should be your ALB

The following links are available for quick-launching some of these resources, should you not want to follow the New VPC method.

|=====================================================

==== The following resources will be provisioned:

- An application load balancer (ALB) which exposes endpoints under `/xl-release` and `/xl-deploy` for the respective applications
- Two XL Release instances in active/active mode, launched as an auto-scaling group
- Target group for XL Release integration with the ALB
- Two XL Deploy instances in active/passive mode, launched as an auto-scaling group
- Target group for XL Deploy integration with the ALB
- Three databases within the provided RDS instance
  * `xlrelease` - The main database for XL Release
  * `xlrarchive` - The reporting database for XL Release
  * `xldeploy` - The main database for XL Deploy
- A CloudWatch dashboard for general monitoring of individual nodes
- CloudWatch alarms to monitor for inaccessible instances, as well as low memory and high CPU on the instances
- CloudWatch log groups for log streaming from XL Release and XL Deploy
- An EFS file system for the work area on XL Deploy
